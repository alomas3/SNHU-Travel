# SNHU-Travel
I interpretted users needs by completing user stories and created a product backlog that ranked each need by its priority. Without the user stories, I would not have had a roadmap when completing this project and, without the user stories, the product would have been irrelevant to the users. 
I approach developing programs with vigorous planning and immaculate time management. I always make sure I am accurate when it comes to following guidelines and I am very resourceful when it comes to overcoming a challenge. In the future I want to incorporate the ability to be flexible to change and to be as effective as possible. Utilizing agile processes such as following Scrum guidelines, will help me be as flexible and as effective as I can be. 
In my opinion team work is everything. A company with one person can not be as successful as a company that values group efforts. Software development requires an environment that takes skills from a number of different people and combines all of those skills and puts those skills towards a complex program that is unique and successful. It goes without saying that two heads are better than one is an important quote to live by in software devlopment, especially if one program could be improved with a different perspective.
